We used JustGarble library for our implementation. A recent half-gates optimization is applied to this construction 
to reduce communication associated with garbled gates.

Setting up JustGarble:
JustGarble is designed to work on x86-64 machines running Linux. JustGarble was tested on Ubuntu 12.10 with gcc-4.6.3,
and expect it to work on similar configurations. You also need to install msgpack.

To compile your code, you need to update Makefile and update T1 in the Makefile. You can compile the code by "make"
command. The executable file will be in /bin directory. 

We broke the whole code in different pieces to make sure the code is runnable in a computer with limited resources.
